Hello, I AM ThatPersonAyuma.
Thanks for visit.

So, the calculator only using Tkinter module and it can only done one assignment at time.
There are 2 type of input. First is the display number, it is a number that you input before
you click on the assigmnet (such as multiply, divison, etc). Also it contains the display number at the moment.
Second is the input number, it is the number you input after the assignment.
The float number I configure it to only have 4 number after the dot (E.g. 3,1415).

If you found something bad or something can be improve or want to discuss something, I open with it.
